# Jamie Bertram Resume

Hi, my name is Jamie Bertram and I am a software developer living in
Ottawa Ontario. This small repository contains the source code used
to generate my resume. To try generating it yourself (or to repurpose
it for your own needs), please read on!  Otherwise, you can download the
most recent copy [here](TODO).

## Acknowledgements

- This project uses [react-html](https://react-pdf.org/) to generate PDF
  documents from React components.
- The design for this resume was heavily inspired by a free resume template
  by Ayoob Ullah, available [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/15815893/FREE-Resume-Template).
